🎯 Project: Personal Budget Tracker (Console App)

🔧 Description:
Create a console-based budget tracker where the user can input income and expenses, and the program keeps track of the total balance, lists all transactions, and allows basic summaries.

🧠 What You'll Learn:
- Input/output using cin and cout
- Using structs or classes
- Vectors or arrays
- Loops and conditionals
- File handling (optional)
- Basic functions

🗂️ Features to Implement:
- Add income/expense
  - User inputs amount, description, and category
  - Store them in a list (vector of structs)
- View transaction history
  - Print all transactions with date, type (income/expense), amount, and description
- Check balance
  - Sum income and expenses to show current balance
- Save/load data (optional advanced)
  - Use file I/O to store and retrieve data between sessions

🧱 Basic Structure Idea:
```cpp
struct Transaction {
    std::string date;
    std::string type; // "Income" or "Expense"
    double amount;
    std::string description;
};
```
You could store all Transactions in a std::vector<Transaction>.

🚀 Suggested Extensions:
- Categorize transactions (e.g., Food, Rent, Salary)
- Generate monthly summaries
- Add password protection (simple authentication)
- Export report to a text file

🕹️ Tools You'll Use:
- iostream
- vector
- iomanip (for formatting output)
- fstream (for file operations)
